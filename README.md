## Features

- **Automated UI Testing:** Fast, reliable cross-browser functional tests with Playwright.
- **Automated API Testing:** REST API validation using Python (pytest + requests).
- **Automated BDD Testing:** Behavior-driven development (BDD) tests using Python (`pytest-bdd` + `requests`) for readable, scenario-based API validation.
- **Postman Collection Testing:** API contract and workflow validation using Postman collections, executed and reported via Newman with HTML output.
- **Infrastructure Provisioning:** Terraform for Azure resources, including Storage Account for hosting reports.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions automates Terraform deployment, test execution, and report publishing.
- **Test Reporting:** HTML reports published to Azure Blob static website, accessible to stakeholders.
- **Cost-Effective:** Uses Azure free tier and open-source tools to minimize costs.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Azure account (free tier is sufficient)
- Terraform installed locally
- Node.js installed (for Playwright)
- Python 3.x with pip
- GitHub account for repository and Actions

#### Azure Service Principal for CI/CD

1. Create a service principal with sufficient permissions:
    ```powershell
    az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "github-ci-sp" --role="Contributor" --scopes="/subscriptions/<YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID>" --sdk-auth
    ```
2. Copy the JSON output from the above command.
3. Add this JSON as a GitHub Secret (e.g., `AZURE_CREDENTIALS`) in your repository settings.

---

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mustafa3946/playwright-api-terraform-demo.git
    cd playwright-api-terraform-demo
    ```

2. **Configure Terraform variables** in `infra/variables.tf` or via environment variables.

3. **Deploy Azure infrastructure:**
    ```bash
    cd infra
    terraform init
    terraform apply
    ```

4. **Run Playwright UI tests:**
    ```bash
    cd ../playwright-tests
    npm install
    npx playwright test
    npx playwright test --grep "@api"
    npx playwright test --grep "@utils"
    ```

5. **Run API, BDD, and Postman tests:**
    ```powershell
    cd ../api-tests/python
    python -m venv .venv
    .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Run all API tests and generate report
    pytest --html=../../reports/index.html --self-contained-html
    # Run BDD scenario tests and generate BDD report
    pytest tests/test_status_check.py --html=../../reports/bdd/index.html --self-contained-html
    ```

6. **Test Postman Collection:**
    ```bash
    npm install -g newman
    npm install -g newman-reporter-html
    newman run ./api-tests/postman/postman_collection.json
    newman run ./api-tests/postman/postman_collection.json -r html --reporter-html-export ./reports/api/postman-report.html
    ```

7. **Azure CLI & Terraform test (optional):**
    ```powershell
    az account set --subscription "your-subscription-id"
    $env:ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="your-subscription-id"
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tests\Test-Terraform.ps1
    ```

8. **Upload test reports to Azure Blob Storage:**
    ```bash
    cd ../../scripts
    ./upload_report.sh
    ```

9. **Check your static site:**
    ```
    https://qaplaywrightstorage.z8.web.core.windows.net/
    ```

## CI/CD Integration

- The GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) automates infrastructure provisioning, test execution, and report publishing on each push or pull request.
- Store secrets such as Azure credentials in GitHub Secrets or a local envirnment variables. **Never commit secrets.**

---

## Best Practices

- **Azure:** Use resource groups for isolation and cost control. Clean up resources when not needed.
- **Terraform:** Use remote state storage (e.g., Azure Storage) for team collaboration and state management.
- **CI/CD:** Keep workflows modular and secure secrets.
- **Testing:** Separate UI, API, BDD, and Postman tests for clarity and maintainability. Use BDD for scenario-driven, human-readable test cases. Use Postman collections for API contract and workflow validation.
- **Reporting:** Ensure BDD, Postman, and other reports are accessible but secure (use SAS tokens or access policies if needed).
